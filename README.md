# Algorithms Aplication Project

This is a github repo for the final project for my algorithms course with Alcibiades.  

## Project Description

The project seeks to implement several algorithms related to graphs. Recapping, a graph is a set of nodes that have defined edges that “point” towards other nodes. This definition of the relationship between nodes creates a structure known as a graph.  
The operations defined in the project are direct implementations of pre-established algorithms. These algorithms modify the data stored within the graph, which allows for specific problem-solving. The algorithms implemented within the project are:  
1.	Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2.	Depth-First Search (DFS)
3.	Kruskal’s Algorithm
4.	Dijkstra’s Algorithm  

These algorithms serve as a baseline for specific problems, of which the following are implemented within the project:  
1.	Detect whether a graph is cyclic
2.	Find a graph’s connected components
3.	Topologically sort a list based on a given graph

## Installing and Running
To install, simply go to the GitHub repo under this link and install the files inside. Alternatively, run the following from your terminal:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tiffie1/algorithms-project
```  

After installing, execute the “main.py” file inside of a terminal. From there, follow the text prompts to utilize the program. If you want to change the graph you are using, you will have to quit the program and run it again.
